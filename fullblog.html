    <h1 class="header">The 7 Habits of Mentally Strong People </h1>

    <h4 class="header">
     These are the habits shared by the mentally strong:</h4>
     
    <section class="text">   <h1  class="header">1. No longer tries to ‘fix’ themselves</h1>
Those who believe they need ‘fixing’ - and if you ask around, many do - will be 
caught in a continual loop of insecurity. 
When we act as though we need to improve who we are, we reinforce the idea 
that something is wrong with us, and therefore maintain a negative self-image. 
It’s not that any of us need fixing - it’s that most of us need to let go of the idea 
that something is wrong with us. In this way, there is no specific set of actions 
we need to take to live an accepting life. 
We are already whole. 
It just requires us to truly see this. 
Then we are free to get back to what we want to do with the full enjoyment 
that springs out of being present.
<h1 class="header">2. Does not tolerate stressful thoughts </h1>
‘People are not disturbed by things, but by the views they take of them.’
―Marcus Aurelius
The mind will continually throw up all kinds of thoughts, without us even 
trying. 
This is a given. Strong people know the inevitability of this, and do not allow 
stressful thoughts to be engaged for long. They may arise, but they are not 
tolerated. We see them merely like little flies buzzing around the head of a 
bull. 
They are there but they are inconsequential. They are not engaged. We turn 
our attention to other things. This makes all the difference.
<h1 class="header"> 3. Uses breathing to slow thoughts</h1> 
There is a close link between breath and the rate at which we cycle through 
new thoughts. Anxiety reflects an overly active mind. 
An active mind also feeds back into an experience of what feels like anxiety. It 
is a loop. 
As such, slowing down our breathing can be used to calm ourselves physically, 
slow down our thoughts and reduce the sensation of anxiety. 
Try it now. 
Take 5 slow breathes in and out through the nose. See how your entire body 
relaxes via the out breath. When our bodies relax, so do our minds become 
still.
<h1 class="header"> 4. Sees the past as an illusion</h1> 
Mentally strong people know that the past is merely a concept. 
It is not real. 
People who suffer tend to buy into the idea that the past is a tangible and 
significant component of their experience. 
They allow thoughts of the past to determine their present behaviour. If they 
were bullied at school, they will justify thoughts about those events to 
determine a present personality that fears criticism, for example. This need not 
be. 
When we can let go of the past’s hold on us, we are free to enjoy the present.
<h1 class="header"> 5. Exercises most days</h1> 
Ideally daily, those who want to maintain a strong mind, understand the mind 
and body connection. 
When we treat ourselves well physically, our brains and minds benefit. 
The mind - you could argue - IS the body in a sense. We are far more 
vulnerable to unhealthy thinking patterns when we haven’t been in motion. 
You know this whenever you spend a lot of time staying still, you will find 
yourself feeling worse and worrying more. Life is motion. 
We are trying to cheat life and joy when we go static for too long.
 <h1 class="header"> 6. Sees the opportunity or lesson in apparent hardship </h1> 
“A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.”
―Seneca
Little improved my life more than taking on the Stoic approach that a lesson is 
found in every hardship. 
Those who suffer have tuned out their capacity to see this. In interpreting the 
challenging event as only a ‘difficulty,’ they close off the alternative view. 
Every challenge can be seen in a fresh light that energises us, if we have the 
patience and willingness to see it. 
For example, I recently had a dream coaching client say no to my proposal to 
work together. I was initially disappointed, but quickly found a way to feel 
better about it. 
I saw the experience as an opportunity to remain calm and therefore grow and 
become stronger, but I also saw it as added incentive to hone my coaching 
craft further and become a better coach. It is always a matter of perspective - 
it is not situational. 
Every problem is an opportunity to grow.
 <h1 class="header">7. Knows ‘the gap’ </h1>
 The gap is the space between a thought and a behaviour response. 
Those who experience a lot of anxiety and stress or are quick to anger have 
cultivated very little by way of this gap. 
The mentally resilient have. 
They know not to react angrily when a button is pushed, rather to allow time 
to pass (gap) for the emotion to subside, before carrying on. Over time, their 
relationship with their ‘gap’ becomes second nature, and not something that 
requires much conscious effort, if any. 
They simply live as the expression of their calm, resilient mind out of practice. 
This is the power of habit.
